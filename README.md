## 💡 Challenge

A huge phone book having pairs in the form of {phone number, person's name} was stored as array having been ordered by
person's name in alphabetical order. Write a little computer program to search this phone book by the person's name and
return its phone number. Take into consideration that the phone book is huge, and the users need the search result to be
the fastest possible.
